## 📦 Resources

Code for Music generation in runtime created by [author](https://twitter.com/eliaskuvoice). Some instrument samples are picked from [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/) example song `Depp`

Emoji Font [Twemoji Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr/releases) is used for cross-platform emoji rendering. Game is able to work without `e.ttf` file, but some icons are incorrect rotation angle, or different at all. But game should be playable anyway.

2D graphics rendering is started from [js13k-2d](https://github.com/kutuluk/js13k-2d) and highly rewritten for what I need.

Sound Effects - [ZZFX](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX).

## How to build

First of all, install dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```

Use `start` script to build and watch for changes, run local server ([localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080))

```shell 
npm start
```

To deploy the game run the `build` script and then start the server
```shell
# build only
npm run build
# run server
node server.js
```

### Modify game config

1. Recommended way to change global game configuration is via `packages/tools/src/config.ts` file. It provides types and some good utilities to compose the final configuration.
2. Generate `packages/client/assets/config.json` by running `npm run config`.
3. Run `npm start` or `npm run build` - scripts will copy `packages/client/assets/config.json` to `public/config.json`, it will be loaded by the game and will be used for all global configuration.

If you need some new option from the code to be exposed in `config.json`, please create the issue.
